1. What is Elbow?
-----------------
Elbow is a serial communication client aimed towards embedded programming language REPLs.

What this means is that elbow can connect to a serial device, and send and receive data to/from it.
It is aimed towards embedded virtual machines such as armpit scheme (http://armpit.sourceforge.net/).

2. Usage.
---------
2.1 Starting up.
----------------
elbow --help is supposed to tell you everything you want to know about elbow options.
The list shown by the help function will always be up to date, whereas this readme might limp a little bit behind.

Currently elbow supports configuring the following properties through commandline options (default):
	- baudrate (9600);
	- device to connect to (/dev/ttyUSB0);
	- end of line character to use (carriage return);
	- file to send before interactive shell starts ();
	- send STX/ETX character to mark start and end of a file transfer (disabled).
(It is likely that default settings are right for a linux host and an armpit scheme target.)

The other switches show help (-?, --help), usage (--usage) and version (-v, --version) information.

2.2 Line by line communication.
-------------------------------
Once elbow is properly started up, you are presented with a GNU Readline interface.
This gives you approximately the same feel as a bash shell, with history and reverse-i-search and much more (see man 3 readline for a lot more information).
Lines are not sent until you hit return, enabling line editing.

Pressing ctrl+d will exit elbow (as will ctrl+c in a less orthodox way :P).
